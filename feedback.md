# Project 3 Feedback

## Project Strengths

* Creative idea with high value proposition.
* The project was ambitious in terms of model relationships, and you did a great job focusing on what was important to the MVP without over-bloating it with features.
* Excellent use of nested resources with `businesses` and `deals`.
* Nice use of partials and Rails helpers in views.

## Areas of Improvement

* See code comments marked with `CJ`
* Include a "fallback" image if the user doesn't upload one when signing up.
* Great use of Bootstrap throughout -- I think it would look even more put-together with a Bootstrap navbar and a cleaner profile page layout (the red, blue, and green banners make it hard to know what to look at).
* Add steps to run the project locally to your `README`.
